Project Purpose
The aim of our project is to create an easy-to-use e-commerce system that will allow the accessory brand Trinket Factory to organize their online workflow for marketing and selling in an efficient way. The project, called Trinket Factory Store, will enable Trinket Factory to showcase their products through an online website for customers.

Project Description
Trinket Factory Store is an e-commerce system that allows customers to view trinkets and accessories available for sale and create online orders for their desired items. The system will also provide Trinket Factory with the capability to add and manage their items efficiently and easily.

Features of the Project
Admin Panel: Admins can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the marketplace inventories.
Item Listing Panel: Users can view the current stock of items registered in the system and create orders.
Shopping Cart: Users can add their contact information, address, and payment method to complete the order.
News Page: Displays discounts and updates on listings. Admins can add news or updates. Users can follow discounts and updates on items.
Project Development Approach
We have diverse technological expertise and aim to challenge ourselves to expand our skills. For instance, Barış will develop the API, while Emre will focus on other aspects. The project will be an ASP.NET web application with a front-end view created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will provide easy navigation for users and allow operations on inventory items. The project will utilize a MySQL database for efficient management and storage of information related to listings and user accounts. APIs, specifically Swagger UI, will be integrated to fetch and incorporate real-time stock data, enhancing the project's functionality and user experience.
